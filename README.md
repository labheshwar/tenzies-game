# Tenzies Game

This project was dual effort of Bob Ziroll from [Scrima](https://scrimba.com/) React Course which is completely free (By the way).

With Scrimba, learning has never been easier. This project was really a fun one because of Scrimba's interactive coding UI.

I was able to complete all the challenges that were assigned by Instructor Bob Ziroll through out the course.
