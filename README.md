# Tenzies Game

This project was dual effort of Bob Ziroll from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) React Course which is completely free (By the way).

With Scrimba, learning has never been easier. This project was really a fun one because of Scrimba's interactive coding UI.

I was able to complete all the challenges that were assigned by Instructor Bob Ziroll through out the course.

## About the Tenzies Game

One of the world's Fastest Dice Game! The object of the game is to get all ten of your dice to show the same number. You need to roll as fast as you can until you get all your dice on the same number Sure there are a few more rules, but you got the idea!

### Add-ons

I also added some features by myself which were not covered in the course.

1 - It now tells you how many times you have rolled the dice.

2 - Added winning screen.
