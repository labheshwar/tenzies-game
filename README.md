# Tenzies Game 🎲

🎉 This project was a dual effort inspired by Bob Ziroll's Scrimba React Course, which is completely free! Thanks to Scrimba's interactive coding UI, learning has never been easier. It was a fun journey working on this project and completing all the challenges assigned by Instructor Bob Ziroll throughout the course.

## About the Tenzies Game

🎲 Tenzies is one of the world's fastest dice games! The objective of the game is to roll all ten of your dice to show the same number. Roll the dice as fast as you can until you achieve the goal of getting all your dice on the same number. Although there are a few more rules, the main idea is to roll your way to victory!

## Add-ons

✨ In addition to the course content, I implemented some additional features to enhance the game experience:

1. 🔄 Roll counter: The game now keeps track of how many times you have rolled the dice, allowing you to monitor your progress.
2. 🏆 Winning screen: Enjoy a celebratory winning screen when you successfully match all ten dice!
